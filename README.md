# Ogre3D script JetBrains-plugin

This plugin utilizes an LSP underneath.
Currently, the plugin employs the classes provided by the Platform Plugin SDK to handle all the client-side aspects of the LSP protocol.
Only the token highlighting is performed by the plugin.

## LSP server

All the code of the server can be found under the repository:
[github.com/inflagames/ogre-scripts-LSP](https://github.com/inflagames/ogre-scripts-LSP)

> The project is developed with C++, and it can be totally reviewed in case of security conserns.

## Build
